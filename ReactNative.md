## React Native 
React Native is a JavaScript framework for building native mobile applications using React. It allows developers to build mobile applications using the same technologies that they use to build web applications, such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Sample code:
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello, React Native!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
export default App;


## Explanation of the code:
This code  defines a simple component called App. This component returns a View element that contains a Text element. The Text element displays the text "Hello, React Native!".

When you run this code, it will create a native mobile application that displays the text "Hello, React Native!".

## Benefits of using React Native:

It is fast and efficient, because it uses native mobile components.
It is easy to learn and use, because it is based on React.
It is flexible, because it can be used to build a wide variety of mobile applications, from simple screens to complex games.
It has a large and active community, which means that there are many resources available to help you learn and use React Native.
Here is a simple code snippet to demonstrate the syntax of React Native:
